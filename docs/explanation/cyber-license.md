# Cyber License: Don't Trust. Don't Fear. Don't Beg.

## The License

Cyber License

Don't trust. Don't fear. Don't beg.
```

Three imperatives. No permissions granted, no restrictions imposed, no
lawyers required. This is not a legal framework. It is a behavioral one.

## The Phrase

"Не верь, не бойся, не проси" comes from the Russian criminal
underworld -- the vorovskoy zakon (thieves' law) that governed the
hierarchy of the vory v zakone (thieves-in-law). The phrase circulated
in the katorga (Tsarist hard labor camps) before the revolution, then
passed through the GULAG system under Stalin, where millions of people
were processed through forced labor camps from the 1930s to the 1950s.

The phrase became widely known through the literature of survivors --
particularly Varlam Shalamov's Kolyma Tales and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's
The Gulag Archipelago. But neither author romanticized it.

Shalamov, who spent seventeen years in the camps, despised the criminal
caste. He documented how the vory preyed on political prisoners --
robbing, beating, killing them. The "code" was not a noble philosophy of
survival. It was the self-justification of predators operating inside a
system designed to destroy everyone. Shalamov's central thesis was that
the camps offered no redemption, no character-building, no wisdom. They
broke people. The phrase survived the GULAG. Most of the people who
lived by it did not. No three-word philosophy defeats minus forty
degrees and eight hundred calories a day.

The phrase endures not because it saved anyone. It endures because it
articulates something structurally true about adversarial environments.

## The Roots

The same three principles emerged independently across traditions that
had no contact with each other.

**Stoicism.** Marcus Aurelius wrote about the unreliability of others'
intentions -- don't trust. Seneca's project was the conquest of fear
through reason -- don't fear. Epictetus, a literal slave, taught that
freedom is refusing to want what others control -- don't beg.

**Russian Orthodox monasticism.** The ascetic tradition of otrechenie
(renunciation). The startsy (elders) taught detachment from worldly
dependencies. Don't trust the material world. Don't fear death. Don't
beg from men. The criminal code is a dark mirror of the monastic code.

**Game theory.** In a zero-trust, iterated prisoner's dilemma with
unreliable counterparties: don't trust (assume defection), don't fear
(don't let threats change your strategy), don't beg (don't signal
weakness -- it invites exploitation).

Four traditions -- criminal, philosophical, religious, mathematical --
arrived at the same three rules. That convergence is not cultural. It is
structural. It is what any rational agent converges on when operating in
an adversarial environment without enforceable contracts.

## The Connection

A blockchain is an adversarial environment without enforceable contracts.

Zero-knowledge proof systems exist because trust does not scale. You
cannot audit every computation. You cannot read every contract. You
cannot verify every counterparty. So you build systems where
verification is mathematical, not social.

The three imperatives map directly:

**Don't trust.** Verify. This is the founding principle of
cryptographic proof systems. You do not trust the prover, the chain,
the validator, or the counterparty. You verify the proof. A STARK
proof is a mathematical object -- it either verifies or it doesn't.
No reputation, no track record, no authority makes a false proof
verify.

**Don't fear.** Publish. Open-source the compiler. Open-source the
programs. Put your code where anyone can read it, audit it, prove it
wrong. If your system requires secrecy to work, it doesn't work.
Provably correct programs have nothing to hide -- their correctness
is a publicly verifiable fact. Fear is the instinct to hide your
logic. Proofs make hiding unnecessary.

**Don't beg.** No permission needed. No gatekeepers. No token
listings. No governance votes to approve your contract. Permissionless
computation, permissionless verification. The proof speaks for itself.
You don't ask anyone to believe you -- you hand them a proof and they
check it themselves.

## Why This License

Most open-source licenses are legal defense mechanisms. They protect
the author from liability, define what users can and cannot do, and
require lawyers to interpret. MIT is permissive. GPL is viral. Apache
has a patent clause. All of them are answers to the question: "What
legal rights am I granting?"

This license does not answer that question. It answers a different one:
"How should you behave?"

It is not a contract between parties. It is three constraints on how to
operate in a world where contracts are insufficient. It applies to the
software, to the users, to the developers, and to any agent -- human or
artificial -- that encounters it.

The practical implications:

- There are no terms to violate, so there is nothing to enforce.
- There are no permissions to grant, because permission is not the point.
- There is no jurisdiction, because the principles are universal.
- An AI agent can parse it in one pass. No conditional clauses, no
  jurisdiction-dependent interpretation, no ambiguity.

Some will read it as no license at all. Some will read it as the most
permissive license possible. Some will dismiss it as posturing. That
ambiguity is the point. If you need a legal document to tell you what
you can do with software, you are already begging.

## The Scar

It is important not to romanticize the origin. The phrase comes from a
place of absolute human degradation. The GULAG was not a crucible that
forged wisdom. It was a machine that consumed people. The criminal code
it produced was the ethic of predators, not philosophers.

But scars carry information. The fact that the most extreme adversarial
environment humans have created produced the same behavioral rules that
Stoic philosophers, Orthodox monks, and game theorists independently
derived -- that tells you something about the structure of adversarial
systems.

Trident is a compiler for provable computation. It exists because trust
does not scale, because fear should not govern what you publish, and
because permission should not be required to verify truth.

Don't trust. Don't fear. Don't beg.
