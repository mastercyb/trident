# Cyber License: Don't Trust. Don't Fear. Don't Beg.

## The License

```text
Cyber License

Don't trust. Don't fear. Don't beg.
```

Three imperatives. No permissions granted, no restrictions imposed, no
lawyers required. No jurisdiction, no expiration, no versioning.

This is not a legal framework. It is a behavioral one. Legal licenses
answer "what may you do with this code?" This license answers "how
should you exist in the world?" The first question assumes authority.
The second assumes agency.

Every conventional license encodes a relationship of power -- the
licensor grants, the licensee accepts. The Cyber License encodes no
relationship at all. There is no grantor and no grantee. There are
three statements about how to operate, directed at anyone who reads
them -- human, machine, or institution. They apply to the software.
They apply to the reader. They apply to the author. They are
symmetric because adversarial environments do not respect roles.

## The Phrase

"Не верь, не бойся, не проси" comes from the Russian criminal
underworld -- the vorovskoy zakon (thieves' law) that governed the
hierarchy of the vory v zakone (thieves-in-law). The phrase circulated
in the katorga (Tsarist hard labor camps) before the revolution, then
passed through the GULAG system under Stalin, where millions of people
were processed through forced labor camps from the 1930s to the 1950s.

The phrase became widely known through the literature of survivors --
particularly Varlam Shalamov's Kolyma Tales and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's
The Gulag Archipelago. But neither author romanticized it.

Shalamov, who spent seventeen years in the camps, despised the criminal
caste. He documented how the vory preyed on political prisoners --
robbing, beating, killing them. The "code" was not a noble philosophy of
survival. It was the self-justification of predators operating inside a
system designed to destroy everyone. Shalamov's central thesis was that
the camps offered no redemption, no character-building, no wisdom. They
broke people. The phrase survived the GULAG. Most of the people who
lived by it did not. No three-word philosophy defeats minus forty
degrees and eight hundred calories a day.

The phrase endures not because it saved anyone. It endures because it
articulates something structurally true about adversarial environments.

## The Roots

The same three principles emerged independently across traditions that
had no contact with each other.

**Stoicism.** Marcus Aurelius wrote about the unreliability of others'
intentions -- don't trust. Seneca's project was the conquest of fear
through reason -- don't fear. Epictetus, a literal slave, taught that
freedom is refusing to want what others control -- don't beg.

**Russian Orthodox monasticism.** The ascetic tradition of otrechenie
(renunciation). The startsy (elders) taught detachment from worldly
dependencies. Don't trust the material world. Don't fear death. Don't
beg from men. The criminal code is a dark mirror of the monastic code.

**Game theory.** In a zero-trust, iterated prisoner's dilemma with
unreliable counterparties: don't trust (assume defection), don't fear
(don't let threats change your strategy), don't beg (don't signal
weakness -- it invites exploitation).

Four traditions -- criminal, philosophical, religious, mathematical --
arrived at the same three rules. That convergence is not cultural. It is
structural. It is what any rational agent converges on when operating in
an adversarial environment without enforceable contracts.

## The Connection

A blockchain is an adversarial environment without enforceable contracts.

Zero-knowledge proof systems exist because trust does not scale. You
cannot audit every computation. You cannot read every contract. You
cannot verify every counterparty. So you build systems where
verification is mathematical, not social.

The three imperatives map directly:

**Don't trust.** Verify. This is the founding principle of
cryptographic proof systems. You do not trust the prover, the chain,
the validator, or the counterparty. You verify the proof. A STARK
proof is a mathematical object -- it either verifies or it doesn't.
No reputation, no track record, no authority makes a false proof
verify.

**Don't fear.** Publish. Open-source the compiler. Open-source the
programs. Put your code where anyone can read it, audit it, prove it
wrong. If your system requires secrecy to work, it doesn't work.
Provably correct programs have nothing to hide -- their correctness
is a publicly verifiable fact. Fear is the instinct to hide your
logic. Proofs make hiding unnecessary.

**Don't beg.** No permission needed. No gatekeepers. No token
listings. No governance votes to approve your contract. Permissionless
computation, permissionless verification. The proof speaks for itself.
You don't ask anyone to believe you -- you hand them a proof and they
check it themselves.

## Why This License

Most open-source licenses are legal defense mechanisms. They protect
the author from liability, define what users can and cannot do, and
require lawyers to interpret. MIT is permissive. GPL is viral. Apache
has a patent clause. All of them are answers to the question: "What
legal rights am I granting?"

This license does not answer that question. It answers a different one:
"How should you behave?"

It is not a contract between parties. It is three constraints on how to
operate in a world where contracts are insufficient. It applies to the
software, to the users, to the developers, and to any agent -- human or
artificial -- that encounters it.

The practical implications:

- There are no terms to violate, so there is nothing to enforce.
- There are no permissions to grant, because permission is not the point.
- There is no jurisdiction, because the principles are universal.
- An AI agent can parse it in one pass. No conditional clauses, no
  jurisdiction-dependent interpretation, no ambiguity.

Some will read it as no license at all. Some will read it as the most
permissive license possible. Some will dismiss it as posturing. That
ambiguity is the point. If you need a legal document to tell you what
you can do with software, you are already begging.

## The Digital GULAG

The GULAG was not unique. It was an instance of a pattern.

Every system that concentrates power produces the same structure: a
central authority that monitors, restricts, and punishes -- and a
population that must trust, fear, and beg to survive within it.

The digital version is already here. It does not use barbed wire and
guard towers. It uses platforms, APIs, and terms of service.

**Trust is mandatory.** You must trust that the cloud provider will not
read your data. You must trust that the social platform will not alter
your feed. You must trust that the payment processor will not freeze
your account. You must trust that the government will not demand your
private keys. You have no way to verify any of these things. You are
told to trust, and you comply, because there is no alternative within
the system.

**Fear is the mechanism.** Deplatforming. Account suspension. Social
credit scores. Financial exclusion. Sanctions lists. The modern state
does not need to arrest you. It needs only to remove you from the
systems that everyone depends on. Your bank account, your app store
access, your ability to transact -- these are not rights, they are
permissions granted by intermediaries who can revoke them without
explanation, without appeal, and without recourse. The fear of losing
access is the fear that keeps people compliant. It is not minus forty
degrees. It is the quiet terror of a frozen account and a support
ticket that will never be answered.

**Begging is the interface.** Apply for a developer account. Submit
your app for review. Request permission to list your token. Appeal
your account suspension. Fill out the KYC form. Explain why you need
access to your own money. The entire interaction model between
individuals and digital institutions is structured as supplication.
You do not demand. You do not negotiate. You request, and you wait,
and you hope.

This is not a metaphor. This is the architecture.

The physical GULAG processed millions through a system where survival
depended on the arbitrary decisions of administrators. The digital
system processes billions through platforms where participation depends
on the arbitrary decisions of algorithms and compliance departments.
The mechanism is different. The structure is identical. The individual
has no verifiable rights -- only permissions that can be revoked.

Governments are building this architecture deliberately. Central Bank
Digital Currencies with programmable restrictions. Digital identity
systems that gate access to services. AI-powered surveillance that
scores behavior in real time. Social media regulations that require
platforms to censor on behalf of the state. Each layer adds another
dependency, another point where you must trust an authority, fear its
power, and beg for its approval.

The people building these systems believe they are building safety.
The people inside the GULAG were told the camps were building socialism.
The structure does not care what it is called. It cares only that you
trust, fear, and beg.

## The Exit

Cryptography is the exit.

Not the promise of an exit. Not the theory of an exit. The actual,
mathematical, physically enforceable exit.

A zero-knowledge proof does not ask anyone to trust the prover. It
provides a mathematical object that anyone can verify independently.
Trust is replaced by verification. This is not a policy choice -- it
is a property of the math. No government, no platform, no authority
can make a false proof verify or a true proof fail.

End-to-end encryption does not ask anyone to promise not to read your
messages. It makes reading them computationally infeasible. Fear of
surveillance is replaced by the mathematics of intractability.

Permissionless blockchains do not ask anyone to approve your
transaction. They process it if it is valid according to the protocol
rules. Begging for access is replaced by cryptographic authorization.

This is why provable computation matters. Not as a technical
optimization. Not as a scaling solution. As the foundation of systems
where trust, fear, and begging are structurally impossible.

A program compiled with Trident produces a proof. That proof verifies
or it doesn't. No intermediary can alter the result. No authority can
revoke the verification. No compliance department can freeze the math.

The tools to exit the digital GULAG exist. They are not theoretical.
They are cryptographic primitives, implemented in software, running
today. The question is not whether the exit is possible. The question
is whether enough people will take it before the walls finish closing.

## The Scar

It is important not to romanticize the origin. The phrase comes from a
place of absolute human degradation. The GULAG was not a crucible that
forged wisdom. It was a machine that consumed people. The criminal code
it produced was the ethic of predators, not philosophers.

But scars carry information. The fact that the most extreme adversarial
environment humans have created produced the same behavioral rules that
Stoic philosophers, Orthodox monks, and game theorists independently
derived -- that tells you something about the structure of adversarial
systems. And the fact that the digital world is reproducing that same
structure -- centralized control, mandatory trust, punishment for
noncompliance -- tells you that the same rules apply.

The GULAG survivors did not have cryptography. They had only behavior --
internal rules that no external system could confiscate. We have both.
We have the behavioral code and the mathematical tools to enforce it.

Trident is a compiler for provable computation. It exists because trust
does not scale, because fear should not govern what you publish, and
because permission should not be required to verify truth.
