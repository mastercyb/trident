program proof_relay

// Proof Relay — Verify and Forward a Single Proof
//
// The simplest composition pattern: verify one inner proof and
// output the verified claim. The outer proof attests:
// "I verified that program P produced outputs O."
//
// This is the building block for cross-chain proof relay:
// a proof generated on chain A can be verified on chain B.
