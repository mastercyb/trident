# 🔱 Trident

## Write once. Prove anywhere

Trident is a programming language for provable virtual machines.

Provable VMs are a new kind of machine. They execute over finite fields,
not bytes. Every instruction is a polynomial constraint. Programs produce
cryptographic proofs, not return values. This is fundamentally different
from conventional computing — and it needs a language built for how the
machine actually works.

Today Trident compiles to [Triton VM](https://triton-vm.org/), powering
[Neptune Cash](https://neptune.cash/) — the only programmable, private,
mineable, quantum-safe blockchain that exists. The architecture supports
[multi-target compilation](docs/explanation/multi-target.md) — the same
source will compile to other proving backends as they ship.

```trident
program hello

fn main() {
    let a: Field = pub_read()
    let b: Field = pub_read()
    pub_write(a + b)
}
```

```bash
trident build hello.tri           # compile to TASM (Triton VM)
```

Feed it to the Triton VM prover and you get a
[STARK proof](docs/explanation/stark-proofs.md) that `a + b = sum` for
secret values of `a` and `b`. Quantum-safe. Zero-knowledge. No trusted
setup. No elliptic curves.

Read the [Vision](docs/explanation/vision.md) to understand why Trident
exists and what it's building toward.

## 🧬 Why a New Language

Provable VMs need a language designed for how they work. Four structural
facts drive every design decision in Trident:

**Arithmetic circuits are not programs.** The machine word is a field
element, not a byte. A language that treats `Field`, `Digest`, and
extension fields as first-class types generates native circuits. One that
wraps byte-oriented code in ZK proofs fights the machine at every step.

**Proofs compose, calls don't.** There is no `msg.sender` calling a
contract. Programs produce independent proofs that a verifier checks
together. Composition is recursive — a proof can verify another proof
inside it, so any chain of proofs collapses into a single proof. Trident
is designed for recursive proof composition — not invocation.

**Bounded execution is a feature.** Circuits must terminate. Loops must
be bounded. This isn't a limitation — it's what makes proofs finite and
costs predictable. The compiler computes exact proving cost from source,
before execution.

**The field is the type system.** Goldilocks prime (2^64 - 2^32 + 1),
cubic extension fields, 5-element digests — these are the native machine
words. The same algebraic structure required for STARK proofs is also
optimal for [quantum computation](docs/explanation/quantum.md). One
design choice, two futures.

### What follows from these facts

What you see is what you prove. Source compiles through a 54-operation
[intermediate representation](docs/reference/ir.md) that maps nearly 1:1 to
target instructions. No optimization engine reorders your operations.

Hash performance dominance. Triton VM executes
[Tip5](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/107) in 1 clock cycle. SP1 needs ~3,000
cycles for SHA-256. RISC Zero needs ~1,000. For hash-heavy applications —
Merkle trees, content addressing, token transfers — this is decisive.
See the [Comparative Analysis](docs/explanation/provable-computing.md).

Formal verification built in. Annotate with `#[requires]` and
`#[ensures]`, run `trident verify`, get a proof of correctness for all
inputs — or a concrete counterexample.
See [Formal Verification](docs/explanation/formal-verification.md).

Content-addressed code. Every function has a unique cryptographic
identity derived from its normalized AST. Audit certificates travel with
the code. See [Content-Addressed Code](docs/explanation/content-addressing.md).

## 🏗️ Examples

Everything below compiles to TASM with `trident build` today.

[Coin](os/neptune/standards/coin.tri) — 535-line fungible token (TSP-1).
Five operations (Pay, Lock, Update, Mint, Burn), time-locks, nullifiers,
configurable authorities, composable hooks.

[Card](os/neptune/standards/card.tri) — Non-fungible token (TSP-2).
Per-asset metadata, royalties, creator immutability, flag-gated
operations. Same PLUMB framework as Coin.

[Lock scripts](os/neptune/locks/) — Generation, symmetric, timelock,
multisig spending authorization.

[Type scripts](os/neptune/types/) — Native currency and custom token
conservation laws.

[Programs](os/neptune/programs/) — Transaction validation, recursive
verification, proof aggregation and relay.

See the [Gold Standard](docs/explanation/gold-standard.md) for the full
PLUMB specification and the [Skill Library](docs/explanation/skill-library.md)
for designed token capabilities.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
cargo build --release            # build from source
trident build main.tri           # compile to TASM
trident check main.tri           # type-check without emitting
trident fmt main.tri             # format source
trident test main.tri            # run #[test] functions
trident verify main.tri          # formal verification
trident package main.tri         # produce .deploy/ artifact
trident deploy main.tri          # package + deploy to registry
```

## 🌳 Source Tree

```text
src/          Compiler in Rust            ~43K lines, 5 runtime dependencies
vm/           VM intrinsics in Trident    Compiler primitives (hash, I/O, field ops)
std/          Standard library in Trident Crypto algorithms (sha256, bigint, ecdsa)
os/           OS bindings in Trident      Per-OS config, programs, and extensions
```

## 🎯 The Endgame

The compiler self-hosts on Triton VM: Trident compiles Trident, producing
a STARK proof that the compilation was correct. Provable compilation.

The source tree reflects this trajectory. `src/` is the Rust bootstrap
compiler — it shrinks as self-hosting progresses. `vm/`, `std/`, and `os/`
are Trident source — they grow. The intrinsic `.tri` files in `vm/` are
already the first pieces written in Trident itself.

Every `trident build` will produce a proof certificate alongside the
assembly — a cryptographic guarantee that the compilation was faithful.
No trusted compiler binary. No trusted build server. You don't trust —
you verify.

## 🧭 Design Principles

1. Field elements all the way down. The core numeric type is a finite field element.
2. Bounded execution. All loops require explicit bounds. No recursion. No halting problem.
3. Compile-time everything. All type widths, array sizes, and costs known statically.
4. Constraints are features. No heap, no dynamic dispatch, no callbacks — safety guarantees.
5. Provable-first. Designed for ZK. These constraints make great conventional programs too.
6. Minimal dependencies. 5 runtime crates: clap, ariadne, blake3, tower-lsp, tokio.
